This is a "Simon Game". The idea is that there is an user interface with two different colored
buttons on it. When you start the game, a button sequence is shown and the player has to mimic the
sequence by clicking the buttons in the right order to gain points. As you complete each 
round the sequences get faster and faster. This was written in C++ and built in Qt
