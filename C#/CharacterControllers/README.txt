These are examples of some character controllers I did for an un-published Unity game. The idea
behind the game is that the player had to controller two objects (a ball and a spring) in order to
traverse a 2D platform game. Each object had different properties such as the spring could jump but the ball couldn't;
together the ball could bounce off the spring, the spring could swing the ball from platforms, and the spring
could launch the ball like a pinball. This was written in C# in Visual Studio
